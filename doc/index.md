# scGenAI Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for **scGenAI**, a comprehensive Python package designed for the prediction and analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data using transformer-based large language models (LLMs). The package enables users to train, fine-tune, and perform predictions on scRNA-seq datasets utilizing models such as LLaMA, GPT, BigBird, and scGenT, with multi-GPU support via PyTorch's DistributedDataParallel (DDP) framework.
